  - name: "What is CPlantBox?"
    text: "CPlantBox is a plant modeling framework that simulates both root and shoot system development. It represents plants as interconnected networks of organs, enabling detailed simulation of plant architectures and environmental interactions. Built on CRootBox's foundation, it can generate diverse root architectures and implement various branching patterns. The framework integrates with photosynthesis and carbon flow modules for comprehensive plant studies."

  - name: "How does it work?"
    text: "CPlantBox follows a streamlined workflow: input file generation, parameter interpretation, topological structure creation, and output visualization. The framework requires specific data structures for accurate modeling of root and shoot systems."
