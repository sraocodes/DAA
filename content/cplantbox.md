  - name: "What is C-PlantBox?"
    text: "C-PlantBox is a full plant modeling framework that focuses on the growth and development of plant architectures, including both the root and shoot systems. It represents the plant as a single topological network of organs. The simulated plant architecture is made up of nodes or coordinates, and these nodes' properties and interactions form the entire network. For the root part, CPlantBox inherits the flexibility of CRootBox, allowing it to generate any type of root architecture. For the shoot, it has implemented various branching and leaf arrangement patterns. By combining these patterns, CPlantBox can simulate many types of shoot architectures. Further, the latest CPlantBox implementation provides linkage with different modules (photosynthesis and carbon flow) within a single framework, enhancing its capabilities and making it a versatile tool for plant studies. Visit the official [CPlantBox repository](https://github.com/Plant-Root-Soil-Interactions-Modelling/CPlantBox) for more information."

  - name: "How does it work?"
    text: "The workflow to use CPlantBox starts with generating input files, then interpreting parameters based on the input file. Following this, the model creates the topological structure from the seed or root, and finally, the output can be written to be visualized.The C-PlantBox framework requires specific data structures for its input to ensure accurate modeling. These structures define the parameters and conditions for both root and shoot systems simulation."
    list:
      - "**Parameter Set**: Defines plant-specific characteristics, such as growth rate, branching frequency, etc."
      - "**Environmental Data**: Information on soil type, humidity, light conditions, and other external factors."
      - "**Initial Conditions**: Defines the starting state of the plant system for simulation. This might include initial root length, shoot height, etc."
      - "**Temporal Data**: Information on how certain parameters might change over time, such as light cycles or seasonal changes."

  - name: "C-PlantBox features"
    text: "CPlantBox incorporated several modules, including those related to the effects of atmospheric variables and plant water status on coupled stomatal opening and photosynthesis. The novel aspect of this latest CPlantBox implementation is the linkage of all these modules within one framework. It aims to test genotype-environment-management interactions and their emergent properties. Technically, it uses graph formalism for organism representation, combining **C++** speed with **Python's** clarity. For example, it has been coupled with the carbon and water flow model, PiafMunch. This coupling allows for fast simulations on complex plant structures, including the simulation of carbon and water flows within the plant. The highlights:"
    list:
      - "It is capable of simulating the growth and development of a variety of plant architectures (root and shoot)."
      - "It is flexible and can be coupled with external modelling tools."
      - "It is open source, highly accessible and source code available on [github](https://github.com/Plant-Root-Soil-Interactions-Modelling/CPlantBox)."
