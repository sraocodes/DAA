  - name: "What is Agro-C ?"
    text: "AGRO-C is a computer model used to understand how carbon moves in and out of agricultural soil, which is called the 'carbon budget' of the farm or field. The model helps scientists understand how much carbon is being absorbed by crops, how much is stored in the soil, and how much is exchanged with the atmosphere. Understanding the carbon budget of agroecosystems has implications for climate change mitigation and sustainable land management."

  - name: "Description of Agro-C Model"
    text: "The Agro-C has two main parts:"
    list:
      - "Crop-C: This part simulates how crops grow and take in carbon from the air during photosynthesis."
      - "Soil-C: This part simulates what happens to the carbon from crop residues and other organic sources in the soil."

  - name: "Crop-C sub-model"
    text: "The Crop-C sub-model in AGRO-C focuses on the journey of carbon in the life of a plant. It calculates how much carbon the plant absorbs from the atmosphere through photosynthesis (also known as Gross Primary Production or GPP). It then considers how much of this carbon the plant uses for its own growth and basic life functions, a process known as Autotrophic Respiration (RA). The remaining carbon, termed as Net Primary Production (NPP), is the balance between what the plant takes in and what it uses. The sub-model also tracks how much of this remaining carbon gets transferred into the soil."

  - name: "Soil-C sub-model"
    text: "The Soil-C submodel in AGRO-C helps us understand how organic carbon moves and changes in agricultural soils. It considers the balance between carbon going into the soil and carbon leaving the soil. By considering these processes, the model gives insight into how carbon levels change in agricultural soils over time."

  - name: "Net Ecosystem Exchange"
    text: "Crop-C and Soil-C submodels are linked through the concept of Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE). NEE represents the balance between carbon gained by the ecosystem and carbon lost by the ecosystem. Understanding NEE helps us determine whether an ecosystem is acting as a net carbon sink (absorbing more carbon than it releases) or a net carbon source (releasing more carbon than it absorbs)."

  - name: "Features"
    text: "The main features of Agro-C are:"
    list:
      - "It aids in understanding the carbon budget of agricultural ecosystems."
      - "It simulates the carbon dynamics considering factors like crop type, management practices, and   climate variables."
      - "It divides the carbon budget into Crop-C and Soil-C for better understanding and prediction."
