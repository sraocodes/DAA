  - name: "What is GRANAR?"
    text: "GRANAR is a sophisticated tool designed to recreate the intricate structure of plant roots at a cellular level. It delves deep into the anatomy of individual root sections, offering explicit representations of root anatomy. You can think of GRANAR like a computer program that can recreate the structure of plant roots on a cell-by-cell basis. For a more hands-on experience, explore the [official GRANAR site](https://granar.github.io/)."

  - name: "GRANAR Features"
    text: "GRANAR is a versatile tool designed for simulating and analyzing root anatomy. Here's a glimpse of its key capabilities:"
    list:
      - "**Detailed Anatomy**: Simulates plant roots at the cellular level, focusing on individual sections."
      - "**Key Dependencies**: GRANAR is built upon several foundational packages, including [`deldir`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=deldir) [`alphahull`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=alphahull) [`retistruct`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=retistruct)"
      - "**Seamless Integration**: Features a MECHA-GRANAR connection for smooth data exchange in XML format, essential for radial conductivity calculations."
      - "**ImageJ Compatibility**: Integrates with ImageJ software for extracting anatomical features from specific datasets."
      - "**Open Data**: Advocates transparency with data available under the CC-BY 4.0 International license."

  - name: "Why GRANAR?"
    text: "GRANAR is more than just a digital tool; it's a bridge to understanding plant roots at a cellular level. When integrated with other models, it can even predict crop performance, revolutionizing farming practices."
    list:
      - "Plant Response Insight: Simulate root anatomies to understand nutrient absorption better."
      - "Plant Breeding Support: Aid breeders in creating drought-resistant crops."
      - "Crop Performance Prediction: When paired with hydraulic models like MECHA, GRANAR can predict root performance under various conditions."

  - name: "GRANAR Limitations"
    text: "While GRANAR is a powerhouse for detailed root anatomy, it doesn't provide a comprehensive view of plant growth and development. It focuses on the cellular level, which means it might not capture the interactions of these root traits with other plant characteristics or environmental variables."
    list:
      - "Scale Specificity: Primarily focuses on cellular-level processes, potentially overlooking higher scale interactions."
      - "Data Dependency: The model's accuracy is heavily reliant on the quality of input data."
      - "Integration Challenges: While it can be coupled with certain models, integration with others might pose challenges."
      - "Assumptions: The model makes certain assumptions and simplifications that might not capture all real-world complexities."
