  - name: "What is GRANAR ?"
    text: "In simple language, you can think of GRANAR like a computer program that can recreate the structure of plant roots on a cell-by-cell 
           basis.GRANAR primarily focuses on the anatomy of individual root sections, rather than simulating the architecture of the entire root 
           system. It generates explicit representations of root anatomy at a cellular scale."

  - name: "GRANAR features"
    text: " The tool enables a detailed exploration of anatomical features like the number of xylem vessels, the proportion of aerenchyma, the size 
            of the stele, cortex width, etc. These are all features that would typically be analyzed in a cross-sectional view of a root, rather than 
            in a whole root system architecture model."

  - name: "Why GRANAR ?"
    text: "GRANAR offers a revolutionary approach to studying plant roots by recreating their structure and functionality at a cellular level 
            digitally. It aids agronomists and breeders in understanding and manipulating root anatomy for more efficient water and nutrient uptake, 
            contributing to resilient and high-yielding crop development. Moreover, coupled with other models, GRANAR can predict crop performance 
            under varying conditions, optimizing farming practices and enhancing precision agriculture."
