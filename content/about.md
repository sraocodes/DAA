  - name: "Core Concept of DAA"
    text: "At its heart, DAA is a digital twin of agricultural systems, designed to bridge the physical and digital realms. By feeding real-time field data into sophisticated computational models, DAA aims to provide a dynamic and interactive representation of crops, offering insights that drive informed agricultural decisions. At the heart of PhenoRob DAA are the process-based models (PBMs). Think of PBMs as the brain behind our digital twin. They simulate how crops respond to various environmental challenges, offering a sneak peek into the future of your crops. It's like having a virtual test field, helping farmers make informed decisions [Learn More](/pbm/). DAA integrates diverse models, from detailed organ-specific analysis to comprehensive field-scale evaluations. Our models include:"

  - name: "Model Integration and Scale Connectivity"
    text: "A core ambition of the PhenoRob DAA is to integrate models across diverse scales, creating a multifaceted view of agricultural systems. We aim to intertwine models like [GRANAR](/granar/), [MECHA](/mecha/), [CPlantBox](/cplantbox/), [AgroC](/agroc/), [SIMPLACE](/simplace/), and [TerrSysMP](/terrsysmp/), to forge a comprehensive understanding of agricultural processes. This integration is important for unraveling the complexities of agricultural ecosystems, from the microcosm of root cell anatomies to the macrocosm of land-atmosphere interactions. Highlighting examples of ongoing [coupling efforts](/couple/), such as linking GRANAR's detailed root anatomies with CPlantBox's whole-plant models, and integrating AgroC's insights on carbon dynamics with TerrSysMP's large-scale environmental simulations, PhenoRob DAA aims to advance predictive power in agricultural science and precision farming."
