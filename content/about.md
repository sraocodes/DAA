  - name: "About PhenoRob DAA"
    text: "The [PhenoRob](https://www.phenorob.de/) Digital Agricultural Avatar (DAA) is a focused sub-project within the overarching PhenoRob initiative. Spearheaded mainly by the teams from [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/) and [ForschungZentrum Juelich](https://www.fz-juelich.de/portal/EN/Home/home_node.html), PhenoRob leverages advanced technology to bring substantial advancements in agriculture. Within this context, the DAA takes on the role of a digital twin for the agricultural system. It amalgamates various models that represent biogeochemical, biophysical, agricultural management, and economic aspects, culminating in a comprehensive tool. By doing so, DAA offers predictive insights, becoming a reliable guide for sustainable farming practices."

  - name: "Process-Based Models"
    text: "A key feature of the PhenoRob DAA is its use of process-based models. Imagine these models as virtual labs where we can simulate how crops respond to different environmental conditions. One crucial factor that these models handle is water availability. By understanding how water influences crop growth and yield, we can optimize irrigation, minimize water usage, and enhance productivity. It's like having a crystal ball to predict how changes in water availability might impact our crops."
