    text: "Welcome to the PhenoRob Digital Agricultural Avatar (DAA)-a software demonstrator project within [PhenoRob](https://www.phenorob.de/index.html). The  demonstrator  will  facilitate  access  and  usability  of  [process based](/pbm/) simulation  agro-models  used  within  PhenoRob under  one  roof. Our aim is to provide information and usage platform to make process based Agro-models available in an  appealing  way  both  for  users  as  well  as  for  the  public.  Also, we aim to offer  interfaces  between  various models so that information can be efficiently transferred and combined among different subprojects within [PhenoRob](https://www.phenorob.de/index.html)."

  - name: "What is Digital Agricultural Avatar?"
    text: "The Digital Agricultural Avatar is  a  digital  twin  of  the  agricultural  system  ultimately  encompassing  interacting  [process based](/pbm/) models  of  the biogeochemical, and -physical, agricultural management and economic components. They simulate how crops respond to various environmental challenges, offering a sneak peek into the future of our crops. It's like having a virtual test field, helping farmers make informed decisions. DAA integrates diverse models, from detailed organ-specific analysis to comprehensive field-scale evaluations. Our models include:"

  - name: "Future Plans"
    text: "The Digital Agricultural Avatar will be a sophisticated modeling framework designed to enhance agricultural decision-making by providing high-resolution data and predictions for crop management at the scale of 50 meters. This platform integrates real-time sensor data, advanced modeling techniques, and forecasts to optimize agricultural practices and resource management. PhenoRob DAA plans to integrate models across diverse scales, creating a multifaceted view of agricultural systems. We aim to intertwine models like [GRANAR](/granar/), [MECHA](/mecha/), [CPlantBox](/cplantbox/), [AgroC](/agroc/), [SIMPLACE](/simplace/), [SCOPE](/scope/) and [TerrSysMP](/terrsysmp/), to forge a comprehensive understanding of agricultural processes. This integration is important for unraveling the complexities of agricultural ecosystems, from the microcosm of root cell anatomies to the macrocosm of land-atmosphere interactions. Highlighting examples of ongoing [coupling efforts](/couple/), such as linking GRANAR's detailed root anatomies with CPlantBox's whole-plant models, and integrating AgroC's insights on carbon dynamics with TerrSysMP's large-scale environmental simulations, PhenoRob DAA aims to advance predictive power in agricultural science and precision farming."
