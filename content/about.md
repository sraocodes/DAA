    text: "The [PhenoRob](https://www.phenorob.de/) Digital Agricultural Avatar (DAA) is a software demonstrator and a sub-project of the [PhenoRob](https://www.phenorob.de/) project. It acts as a digital twin of the agricultural system, encompassing interacting models of biogeochemical, biophysical, agricultural management, and economic components. This groundbreaking initiative unifies diverse modelling approaches and observations under a single [PhenoRob](https://www.phenorob.de/) brand, thereby providing a unified solution for stakeholders."

  - name: "Advantages of PhenoRob DAA"
    text: "The PhenoRob DAA facilitates access and usability of simulation models such as TerrSysMP, AgroC, SIMPLACE, CPlantBox and DuMux-Rosi. These models help mimic reality from lab, to field, regional, and continental scales, enabling predictions and forecasts of plant biomass, yield, water, and nutrient use efficiency. The DAA demonstrator not only provides an information and usage platform for users, but also creates a public-facing platform to showcase the project's innovative approaches and results."

  - name: "Connecting Subprojects"
    text: "PhenoRob DAA serves as a vital connecting point for various subprojects, facilitating collaborations and joint publications. It efficiently transfers and combines information among different subprojects. Over time, digital twins of various PhenoRob field sites will be created, thereby enhancing the project's external presentation and promotional capacity."
