    description: "AgroC model is a comprehensive system for simulating various environmental and ecological processes. Key functionalities include the modeling of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles, management of solute and water flow dynamics, and the simulation of plant growth and material properties under varying environmental conditions. The modules integrate complex data related to soil chemistry, atmospheric interactions, and biological processes, providing detailed outputs on environmental variables and system dynamics. "
