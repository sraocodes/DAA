  - name: "What is TerrSysMP?"
    text: "TerrSysMP, or Terrestrial Systems Modeling Platform (TSMP), is a comprehensive, open-source modeling platform designed for studying land-atmosphere interactions at both regional and continental scales. It is constituted by coupling the COSMO or ICON atmospheric models with the Community Land Model (CLM) and the ParFlow model. This platform allows for the detailed representation of environmental dynamics, including feedbacks in the hydrological cycle. Visit the official [TerrSysMP site](https://www.terrsysmp.org/) for the installation guide."

  - name: "How does it work?"
    text: "TerrSysMP integrates its component models using the OASIS3-MCT coupler to control the exchange of fluxes, enabling simulations of the entire land-atmosphere system. The platform can be run on both notebooks and latest supercomputers, offering flexibility and scalability for different research requirements."

  - name: "TerrSysMP Components"
    text: "TerrSysMP brings together three main components:"
    list:
      - "COSMO or ICON Model: Used for atmospheric simulations, covering both NWP and climate modes."
      - "CLM (Community Land Model): Focuses on surface interactions like energy, moisture, and carbon exchanges."
      - "ParFlow: Simulates groundwater flows and integrates with a two-dimensional overland flow simulator."
  - name: "TerrSysMP features"
    text: "The main features of TerrSysMP are:"
    list:
      - "Simulates complex interactions between atmosphere, land surface, and subsurface hydrodynamics."
      - "Offers detailed studies for water cycle research, climate change simulations, and more."
      - "Is open-source, highly accessible, with the source code available on [github](https://github.com/HPSCTerrSys/TSMP)."
      - " For more information, refer to [TerrSysMP site](https://www.terrsysmp.org/)"
  - name: "Development and Contributors"
    text: "TSMP's development has been led by groups within the Center for High-Performance Scientific Computing in Terrestrial Systems (HPSC-TerrSys), which is a part of the Geoverbund ABC/J, a geoscientific network. This includes collaborations with the University of Cologne, Bonn University, RWTH Aachen University, and the Research Centre Jülich, primarily based in Jülich and Bonn, Germany."
