  - name: "What is TerrSysMP?"
    text: "TerrSysMP, or Terrestrial Systems Modeling Platform (TSMP), is a comprehensive modeling platform designed to simulate and study land-atmosphere interactions. It's constituted by three main components: the COSMO model for atmospheric simulations, the Community Land Model (CLM) for surface interactions, and the ParFlow model for simulating groundwater flows. The platform allows for the detailed representation of various environmental dynamics and their interactions. Visit the official [TerrSysMP site](https://www.terrsysmp.org/) for the installation guide."

  - name: "How does it work?"
    text: "TerrSysMP works by integrating different component models to simulate the entire land-atmosphere system. The COSMO model is used for atmospheric simulation, CLM simulates land surface processes, and ParFlow simulates groundwater and surface water flow. These models are coupled using the Ocean Atmosphere Sea Ice Soil (OASIS3) coupler, controlling the exchange of fluxes between each independent component. The platform can be run in different configurations for varied degrees of complexity and detail."

    text: "TerrSysMP integrates three major components:"
    list:
      - "COSMO Model: A convection-permitting numerical weather prediction model used for atmospheric simulation."
      - "CLM (Community Land Model): A land surface model that simulates surface energy, moisture, and carbon fluxes between the shallow soil, snow, vegetation, and the atmosphere."
      - "ParFlow: A variably saturated, groundwater flow model integrated with a two-dimensional overland flow simulator for simulating groundwater flows."
  - name: "TerrSysMP features"
    text: "The main features of TerrSysMP are:"
    list:
      - "It is capable of simulating the complex interactions between the atmosphere, land surface, and subsurface hydrodynamics."
      - "It integrates different models for atmosphere, surface, and groundwater simulation."
      - "It can improve understanding of land-atmosphere interaction and hydrologic predictions."   
      - "It is open-source, highly accessible, and source code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/HPSCTerrSys/TSMP)."
