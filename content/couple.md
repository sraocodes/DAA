  - name: "Model Coupling"
    text: "At PhenoRob Digital Agricultural Avatar (DAA) initiative We have plans to use model coupling as an essential strategy to offer a more comprehensive and accurate representation of the crop ecosystem. While we are currently working on combining plant scale functional and structural models like [CPlantbox](/Phenorob-DAA/cplabtbox/) with crop and regional scale models like [AGROC](/Phenorob-DAA/agroc/), some coupling examples are already worth mentioning such as that of models GRANAR-MECHA and SIMPLACE-CPlantbox"

  - name: "GRANAR-MECHA"
    text: "The first example of coupling is that of [GRANAR](/Phenorob-DAA/granar/) and [MECHA](/Phenorob-DAA/mecha/), two computational tools that, when combined, offer a holistic view of root anatomy and hydraulics. The coupling of GRANAR, a computational tool designed to generate digital versions of monocotyledon root     anatomical networks, with MECHA, a model estimating root hydraulic properties, has been transformative.Explore more about [GRANAR-MECHA here](/casestudy2/)"

  - name: "SIMPLACE-CPlantbox"
    text: "Soil compaction, especially at greater depths, is a growing concern in modern agriculture. To address this, [SIMPLACE](/Phenorob-DAA/simplace/) and [CPlantbox](/Phenorob-DAA/cplantbox/) was coupled, providing new insights into the implications of deep soil compaction and its effects on plant growth.Explore more about [SIMPLACE-CPlantbox here](/casestudy1/)"
