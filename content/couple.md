  - name: "Introduction"
    text: "The PhenoRob Digital Agricultural Avatar (DAA) initiative is poised to redefine the boundaries of agronomic understanding. At this foundational stage, the DAA project envisions harnessing the power of coupling to bridge the complexities of crop modeling. From the nuanced molecular interactions within plant cells to vast regional climate patterns, the plan is to use coupling as an essential strategy in the DAA framework. By aiming to integrate various models in the future, the DAA aspires to offer a more comprehensive and accurate digital twin of the crop ecosystem."

  - name: "Case Study: GRANAR-MECHA"
    text: "Our phenorob [team](/Phenorob-DAA/members/) members have pioneered this understanding by coupling [GRANAR](/Phenorob-DAA/granar/) and [MECHA](/Phenorob-DAA/mecha/), two computational tools that, when combined, offer a holistic view of root anatomy and hydraulics. The coupling of GRANAR, a computational tool designed to generate digital versions of monocotyledon root     anatomical networks, with MECHA, a model estimating root hydraulic properties, has been transformative. This combination has empowered researchers to:"

  - name: "Case Study: SIMPLACE-CPlantbox"
    text: "Soil compaction, especially at greater depths, is a growing concern in modern agriculture. To address this, our AR team members have innovatively coupled [SIMPLACE](/Phenorob-DAA/simplace/) with [CPlantbox](/Phenorob-DAA/cplantbox/), providing groundbreaking insights into the implications of deep soil compaction and its effects on plant growth. By integrating SIMPLACE, a process-based model focusing on crop-level dynamics, with CRootbox, a detailed root architectural model, our [team](/Phenorob-DAA/members/) has:"
