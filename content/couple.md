  - name: "Model Coupling"
    text: "The PhenoRob Digital Agricultural Avatar (DAA) initiative is poised to redefine the boundaries of agronomic understanding. At this foundational stage, the DAA project envisions harnessing the power of coupling to bridge the complexities of crop modeling. From the nuanced molecular interactions within plant cells to vast regional climate patterns, the plan is to use coupling as an essential strategy in the DAA framework. By aiming to integrate various models in the future, the DAA aspires to offer a more comprehensive and accurate digital twin of the crop ecosystem.While specific implementations are still on the horizon, the goal is to amalgamate different models, ensuring the digital twin effectively represents the vast agronomic system. Through planned coupling techniques, the DAA aims to achieve several key benefits:"

    text: "The first example of coupling is that of [GRANAR](/Phenorob-DAA/granar/) and [MECHA](/Phenorob-DAA/mecha/), two computational tools that, when combined, offer a holistic view of root anatomy and hydraulics. The coupling of GRANAR, a computational tool designed to generate digital versions of monocotyledon root     anatomical networks, with MECHA, a model estimating root hydraulic properties, has been transformative.Explore more about [GRANAR-MECHA here](/casestudy2/)"

    text: "Soil compaction, especially at greater depths, is a growing concern in modern agriculture. To address this, [SIMPLACE](/Phenorob-DAA/simplace/) and [CPlantbox](/Phenorob-DAA/cplantbox/) was coupled, providing new insights into the implications of deep soil compaction and its effects on plant growth.Explore more about [SIMPLACE-CPlantbox here](/casestudy1/)"
