  - name: "Multi-Scale Models"
    text: "The [DAA](/about/) initiative, proudly integrates multi-scale modeling as a cornerstone of its vision. By coupling two or more process-based models, these multi scale representations provide insights into the comprehensive Genetic-Environment-Management (GEM) interactions that define agricultural ecosystems. These multi-scale modeling framework, encapsulating everything from intricate plant cell processes to vast ecosystem dynamics, function as the underpinnings of our cutting-edge approach towards sustainable agriculture.In crop modeling, the processes can vary from the micro to the macro level, both spatially and temporally.

    text: "The act of connecting different scales in crop modeling holds critical significance. It aids in assessing agricultural strategies for climate change adaptation, ensuring food security, and promoting environmental sustainability. The intricate G × E × M interactions (Genetics, Environment, Management) profoundly affect crop development, growth, and yield. Given their complexity and nonlinear nature, they pose challenges for empirical experimental designs."

  - name: "Model Coupling"
    text: "Multi-scale modeling is achieved by effectively coupling standalone models at varying scales. The process of coupling refers to the harmonized exchange of information between at least two distinct models. Within the complex interplay of soil, plant, and atmosphere, coupling serves as a robust strategy to capture intricate interactions and dependencies. In essence, coupling amplifies the holistic representation of the crop system, enhancing both its comprehensibility and fidelity. [Learn more](/couple/)"
