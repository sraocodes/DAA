    heading: "What is DAA?"
    text: |
      Digital Agricultural Avatar (DAA) serves as a digital twin of the agricultural system, integrating biogeochemical, physical, management, and economic models. The DAA aims to achieve full model-data reciprocity, empowering 
      stakeholders with unparalleled insights.

    heading: "Multi-Scale Models"
    text: "GRANAR and MECHA models scrutinize cell-level granular processes and mechanical phenomena. DUMUXROSI and CPLANTBOX models focus on plant and organ scales, investigating water transport, growth, and development. SIMPLACE, AGROC, and TSMP models operate at crop and regional scales, unraveling crop growth, carbon dynamics, and broader agricultural interactions."

    heading: "GRANAR"
    text: |
      GRANAR is a cutting-edge tool that recreates the cellular structure of plant roots. It not only provides in-depth root anatomy but, when combined with other models, predicts crop performance, aiding in drought-resistant plant breeding.
