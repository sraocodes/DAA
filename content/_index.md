    heading: "What is DAA?"
    text: |
      Digital Agricultural Avatar (DAA) serves as a digital twin of the agricultural system, integrating biogeochemical, physical, management, and economic models. The DAA aims to achieve full model-data reciprocity, empowering 
      stakeholders with unparalleled insights.

    heading: "Multi-Scale Models for Agricultural Solutions"
    text: "GRANAR and MECHA models scrutinize cell-level granular processes and mechanical phenomena. Dumux-ROSI and CPLANTBOX models focus on plant and organ scales, investigating water transport, growth, and development. Simplace, AgroC, and TerrSysMP models operate at crop and regional scales, unraveling crop growth, carbon dynamics, and broader agricultural interactions."
