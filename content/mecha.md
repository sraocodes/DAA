  - name: "What is MECHA"
    text: "MECHA is a mathematical model that helps to understand how water flows through the roots of plants. It takes into account the different structures within the root, such as cell walls and membranes, and calculates how water moves through them. This model can be used to test different hypotheses about how water is transported in roots and can help to improve our understanding of plant water relations. For more details, please visit the official site of MECHA [here](https://mecharoot.github.io//)."

  - name: "Why MECHA"
    text: "MECHA is a useful tool that can help plant breeders to test different scenarios and hypotheses related to root water/nutrient transport. By using MECHA, researchers can get a better understanding of how plants capture and transport water, which is important for optimizing crop yields and improving agricultural sustainability. This knowledge can then be used to inform future research and agricultural practices, ultimately leading to more efficient and sustainable crop production."
  - name: "Limitations of MECHA"
    text: "While MECHA is a powerful tool, it does have certain limitations (like any other models):"
    list:
      - "Dimension Limitation: The current form of MECHA does not incorporate a third spatial dimension, which could limit its accuracy in predicting water pressure and flow along roots."
      - "Focus on Hydraulics: MECHA primarily focuses on the hydraulic properties of cells, and may not fully account for other environmental factors affecting plant water relations."
      - "Data Dependency: The model requires detailed and accurate input data, and includes assumptions that might not fully capture the complexities of real-world processes."
