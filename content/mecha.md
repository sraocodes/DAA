  - name: "What is MECHA?"
    text: "MECHA is a mathematical model that aids in understanding the movement of water through plant roots. This model considers various root structures, including cell walls and membranes, to calculate water flow. The tool enables researchers to examine various hypotheses about root water transport, enhancing our grasp on plant water relations. Dive deeper into MECHA by visiting its [official site](https://mecharoot.github.io/)."

  - name: "Why MECHA?"
    text: "MECHA proves invaluable for plant breeders, enabling them to simulate various scenarios and hypotheses related to root water/nutrient transport. Leveraging MECHA, researchers can better understand plant water absorption and transportation, which is pivotal for maximizing crop yields and bolstering agricultural sustainability. Such insights can drive future agricultural research and best practices."

  - name: "MECHA File Structure"
    text: "To facilitate accurate simulations, MECHA employs a specific file structure. Familiarizing yourself with this structure can optimize your usage of the model."
    list:
      - "**INPUT FILES**: MECHA requires four parameter files stored in the /in folder:"
      - "General.xml: Covers general simulation parameters."
      - "BC.xml: Sets boundary conditions for the simulation, determining if the soil is dry, wet, or partially in contact with the root."
      - "Geometry.xml: Defines the root section geometry parameters, allowing you to select the root section for the simulation."
      - "Hydraulics.xml: Covers the hydraulic parameters of various simulation variables."
      - "**OUTPUT FILES**: MECHA saves output files in a folder specified in the General.xml input file, under the Output tag. These files include:"
      - "*.PVTK files: Geometry files compatible with Paraview."
      - "Macro_prop_i.txt files: These provide a summary of simulation results, incorporating the radial data."
    textPosition: "right"

  - name: "Limitations of MECHA"
    text: "Despite MECHA's prowess, it does have certain constraints:"
    list:
      - "Dimension Limitation: MECHA currently operates in two dimensions, potentially affecting its precision in predicting water pressure and root flow."
      - "Focus on Hydraulics: The model emphasizes the hydraulic properties of cells, potentially overlooking other environmental factors impacting plant water relations."
      - "Data Dependency: MECHA necessitates detailed and precise input data, incorporating assumptions that might not encompass the intricacies of real-world processes."
