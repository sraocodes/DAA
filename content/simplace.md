    text: "SIMPLACE is an open-source software that helps scientists and farmers manage crops and ecosystems better. It uses computer models to understand complex interactions between crops, soil, and climate. By coupling different modules, each representing a process like water use or plant growth, SIMPLACE offers customizable solutions for different agricultural needs.Its multi-threaded high-performance architecture allows for calibration and simulations at varying spatial scales.You can check the official site of SIMPLACE [here](https://www.simplace.net/index.php)."

  - name: "What can SIMPLACE do?"
    text: "SIMPLACE can help in understanding how climate change affects crops, finding ways to improve farming practices, and developing useful tools for farmers and policymakers. For example, SIMPLACE has a special component that helps study how heat stress affects crops. It also offers an advanced module that looks into soil water balance in great detail. Its customizable nature allows users to choose and combine different components depending on their specific needs."

    text: "SIMPLACE has been used to simulate the growth and development of various crops in numerous studies:"
    list:
    - "[Srivastava et al. (2022)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2022.1058775/full) used SIMPLACE to estimate the yield gaps of cassava at the state level in Nigeria."
    - "[Rezaei et al. (2018)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23101-2) used SIMPLACE to quantify the effect of using the phenology traits of cultivars planted in the 1950s and 1960s as compared to modern cultivars on wheat growth simulations in Germany."
    - "[Tao et al. (2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S037842901530071X) used eight models, including SIMPLACE, to design future crop ideotypes for barley in Finland and Spain by linking model parameters and genotypic traits."
    - "[Seidel et al. and Yin et al. (2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1161030116302532?casa_token=5VaxkhAkQK0AAAAA:HBlTek58V58Y8OFY1oLg7ToSil5OHDw0-RKeqxs_a5_-0V3NnA6sMXhsbGZmC4PEFpSsnw0W3g) used SIMPLACE to simulate crop rotations and nutrient uptake to analyze the impact of P fertilizer omission on the biomass production of five crops in a long-term experiment in Dikopshof, Germany."
    - "[Hoffmann et al. (2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308521X16305947) used twelve models, including SIMPLACE, to assess how inter-annual variability of attainable yield affects the magnitude of yield gaps for wheat and maize across ten sites with contrasting environmental conditions."
    - "[Kollas et al. (2015)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1161030115300010) conducted the first model inter-comparison study on crop rotations considering fifteen crop models, including SIMPLACE, and ten different crops, including wheat and maize."

  - name: "Getting Started with SIMPLACE"
    text: "Diving into SIMPLACE? Great choice! At its core, SIMPLACE is crafted using Java, making it versatile and widely compatible. Whether you're a beginner or an expert, SIMPLACE offers tools that cater to all levels of expertise. Here's a quick guide to get you started:"
    list:
      - "Data Handling: SIMPLACE has a unique way of managing data. It can link to external data sources and store them for simulations. Plus, it has built-in tools to ensure the data fits just right for your specific needs."
      - "Development Environment: If you've heard of Eclipse, you're in luck! It's the recommended tool to work with SIMPLACE. It's like a one-stop-shop for editing, testing, and managing your SIMPLACE projects."
      - "Advanced Features: For those who love to tinker, SIMPLACE lets you create new components, play around with XML files, and even run specific Java tests to ensure everything's running smoothly."
